## 🚀 Featured Projects
Here are some of my most significant projects that demonstrate my expertise in combining software development, electronics, and artificial intelligence:

 - **Automated Robotic Bartender**: Developed a complete human-robot interaction system using a UR3 robotic arm, computer vision (YOLO for object detection), and a custom user interface. The system allows a user to select a drink, which is then identified by the camera and precisely picked and placed by the robot.

 - **Braille Character Recognition & Translation**: Built a system utilizing advanced computer vision techniques and AI models to recognize and translate Braille characters from images into text, aiming to create assistive technology tools.

 - **Intelligent Traffic Control with Reinforcement Learning**: Modeled and simulated traffic flow on Madrid's Gran Via. Implemented Reinforcement Learning algorithms to dynamically control traffic lights, significantly optimizing traffic and reducing congestion in the simulation.

 - **AI-Powered Additive Manufacturing Inspector**: Designed and trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to perform automated quality control in 3D printing. The system analyzes images of each printed layer in real-time to detect anomalies such as under-extrusion (lack of material) or over-extrusion (excess material), predicting print       failures before they happen.

 - **Smart Pet Habitat with Raspberry Pi**: Architected and built a comprehensive home automation system centered on pet care. The project integrates a Raspberry Pi with various sensors and actuators to automate a pet door, control timed feeding, regulate ambient temperature, and includes an emergency fire escape route for the animal.

 Some of my other projects involve:

 Low-level systems programming in C for process control, inter-process communication (IPC), and memory management.

 Data science, machine learning, and AI development in Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch).

 Embedded systems and electronics projects using microcontrollers (Arduino, ESP32) and Single-Board Computers (Raspberry Pi).
